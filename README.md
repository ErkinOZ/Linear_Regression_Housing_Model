Prediction Error Analysis – Personal Reflections
By Erkin Ozkan

Working on this project has given me valuable hands on experience in predictive modeling using linear regression. I started with a simple idea predicting house prices and gradually uncovered deeper insights into error distribution, model evaluation, and areas for improvement.

📊 Understanding the Model’s Performance
Through this analysis, I observed that our model follows an approximately normal error distribution, but with slight skewness. Most predictions were fairly accurate, but some outliers indicated nonlinear relationships that a simple linear regression model couldn't fully capture.
Breaking down the errors into Accurate (≤5%), Moderate (5-15%), and Poor (>15%) helped me identify areas for improvement and evaluate the reliability of our predictions.

🔍 Key Learnings & Future Improvements

1️⃣ Feature Engineering Matters – Adding polynomial features, interaction terms, or external factors like neighborhood data could improve accuracy.

2️⃣ Linear Regression Has Limits – While it provides interpretability, complex datasets may require nonlinear models like Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.

3️⃣ Cross-Validation is Essential – Instead of relying on a single train-test split, I now understand the importance of k-fold cross-validation to assess model robustness.

4️⃣ Handling Outliers & Data Quality – Investigating extreme errors can help identify missing variables or data inconsistencies affecting predictions.

🚀 My Next Steps
This project was a great introduction to predictive modeling, but I now want to explore more advanced techniques:

Testing Random Forests & XGBoost for better generalization
Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning (Lasso, Ridge)
Applying these insights to real-world financial forecasting
🔹 Final Thought: This was my first deep dive into building a predictive model, and it has been both challenging and rewarding. Now, I'm eager to refine my skills further and experiment with more advanced models! 🚀
