Analysis of the Prediction Error Distribution
From the given dataset, we analyzed the prediction errors between the actual house prices and the predicted prices using our linear regression model. The error was computed as:
Error = Actual Price - Predicted Price
Error % = (|Error| / Actual Price) * 100

📊 Understanding the Error Distribution
• We visualized the distribution of error percentages using a histogram.
• A Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) line was overlaid to show the smooth distribution.
• Two vertical reference lines were added:
   - Green dashed line at 5%: Represents the threshold for predictions classified as 'Accurate'.
   - Red dashed line at 15%: Represents the threshold for predictions classified as 'Moderate'.
   - Predictions beyond 15% error were classified as 'Poor'.
📌 Observations
1. Shape of the Distribution:
   - The histogram shows a distribution that is approximately normal, but slightly skewed.
   - Most of the errors are centered around 0%, indicating a relatively balanced model.
   - There are some outliers on both ends, meaning a few predictions were significantly off.
2. Classification of Predictions:
   - Accurate Predictions (≤ 5% error) → 1,110 samples
   - Moderate Predictions (5% - 15% error) → 1,123 samples
   - Poor Predictions (> 15% error) → 267 samples
3. Model Performance:
   - The majority of predictions (over 88%) fall within the Accurate & Moderate categories, which means the model performs reasonably well.
   - Around 11% of the data points have a large error (>15%), which might indicate missing important features or nonlinear relationships.
🛠️ Recommendations for Improvement
1. Feature Engineering:
   - Introduce polynomial features or interaction terms to capture nonlinear relationships.
   - Add external features such as neighborhood ratings, crime rates, and local economic indicators.
2. Try Non-Linear Models:
   - The linear regression model assumes a straight-line relationship between variables, which may not always hold true for housing prices.
   - Consider using Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Models (GBM).
3. Handle Outliers:
   - Investigate properties where the prediction error is extremely high (> 15%).
   - These could be luxury properties or unique cases where linear regression fails.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Experiment with different train-test split ratios and regularization techniques (Lasso, Ridge).
   - Use Cross-Validation to improve model generalization.
🔎 Conclusion
The model provides a good fit for predicting house prices, but further refinements can be made. While the majority of predictions fall within an acceptable range, some cases exhibit high errors. Addressing nonlinearity and feature importance will enhance the model's reliability.
